# Unofficial WAAW add-on for Kodi

## This project is now archived.

This project is now part of [ResolveURL](https://github.com/Gujal00/ResolveURL/blob/master/script.module.resolveurl/lib/resolveurl/plugins/waaw.py). Therefore it doesn't make sense for me to maintain a separate version as this was more of a simple proof of concept code. Further development will happen in ResolveURL's version.
